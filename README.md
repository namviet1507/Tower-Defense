# Tower Defense
+ Tower Defense Game using OOP and C++ language | Ho Chi Minh City University of Science
+ Lecturer: TRUONG TOAN THINH
## 1. Introduction
- In this project we will combine techniques, basic data structures as well as objectoriented knowledge to build a simple game, tower defense.
- To carry out this project, we need basic knowledge such as: file handling, processes, basic data structures and object-oriented knowledge...
- The tutorial helps students build games at a basic level, and groups research on their own to complete it in the best way possible.

## 2. Screenplay
- At the beginning of the game, a map and a table of parameters will appear that need the player to determine. Once all parameters are available, the game operates automatically, and players wait to see the results.
- When all the “characters” are destroyed or when one of the characters has reached the finish line, the program will notify the player to select the ‘y’ key if they want to continue (the program will reset to the original state) or select ‘any key’ if you want to exit the game.
- When you destroy all the characters, you advance to a new level (for example, the number of characters is larger, or the character can resist...). When you reach a certain level, it is considered a victory or the game restarts as at the beginning.

## 3. REQUIREMENTS
In the above instructions, we still lack basic functions
### Handle collisions between characters and bullets
- A group of students should design collision effects to make the game more attractive
### Handles saving games/loading saved games
- Students add the save/load function when the user needs to save the game or select a previously saved game to continue playing.
### Design how to play when the game screen appears
- In the instructions, when running the program, the game immediately starts. However, the student group should redesign it so that when entering the game, the player must be shown the map, the location where towers can be built or the number of characters/paths so that the player can predict and choose appropriate parameters suitable to win the level.
### Handling of game levels
- Students build the game having at least 4 levels and corresponding to 4 different maps in the game. Speed can be used as one of the difficulty factors for each level.
### Building menu
- Build game menus like “new game”, “load game”, or “setting…”. It is necessary to build 2 types of sounds: background sound and playing sound. Remember to have the on/off function.
### Other advanced functions
- In addition to the mentioned functions, groups need to think of a special function of their own (Note that this is a special function, groups do not share ideas with other groups)
